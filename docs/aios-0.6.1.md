# AIOS v0.6.1 compatibility

AI Operations Specification repository v0.6.1 adds the first v0.6.x drafts:

- [provenance records](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/ai-operations-spec/blob/v0.6.1/specification/v0.6/provenance.md): a
  `spec_version: "0.6-draft"`, `artifact_type: "provenance"` companion artifact
  with subjects, source references, derived findings and evidence lineage;
- a [portable conformance suite](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/ai-operations-spec/tree/v0.6.1/specification/v0.6/conformance-suite)
  with expected outcomes and rule citations;
- [naming conventions](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/ai-operations-spec/blob/v0.6.1/specification/v0.6/naming-conventions.md).

Run and Workflow artifacts stay `0.4-draft`; the v0.4 schemas and
`AIOS-0.4-*` rule catalog are unchanged, so existing exports remain valid.
Consumers that do not check `0.6-draft` must reject provenance records under
`AIOS-0.5-V03` rather than validate them against v0.4.

## Agentic Chaos

Chaos Run exports stay `0.4-draft` and keep their `io.deepagentlabs.agentic-chaos` extension. A provenance record written by another tool may cite a Chaos `reliability_event` or the derived `resilience_score` Run as an `aios_object` source; Chaos itself does not emit provenance records, and citing a score does not make it an Evals result or a containment guarantee.

## Dependencies

No runtime dependency floor changes and no package release are needed for
this documentation alignment. Independent review is still pending; passing the
suite or holding a verified provenance record is not stable conformance and
does not show that any artifact or finding is true. See the
[AIOS ecosystem guide](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/ai-operations-spec/blob/v0.6.1/docs/v0.6.1-ecosystem.md).
