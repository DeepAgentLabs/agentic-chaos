# Sidecar 0.8 integration boundary

## Sidecar 0.8 interoperability

Chaos 0.5.3 remains the fault/event producer. Sidecar checks recovery proposals
with native Chaos event IDs; it does not implement fault injection here.

Sidecar 0.8 provides Shared/Exclusive context-only, guardrails-only or combined
configuration, explicit host context delivery and mandatory guardrail composition.
Exclusive rules cannot weaken shared restrictions. Cross-framework privacy,
revocation and delegated authority remain v0.9 validation; stable schemas remain
v1.0. Native correlated Lens readback requires Lens 0.7.1. All sibling packages
stay optional; no dependency floor is increased without a runtime requirement.
